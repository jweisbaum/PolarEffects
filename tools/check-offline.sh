# Enforces invariant 4: nothing is fetched that the user did not ask for, and
# HTTP is limited to two crates; pe-app holds the MCP service's loopback
# listener (D29), whose server crates layer 2 admits and nothing else. pe-app
# alone may read the person's SYRF PostgreSQL database, read-only and only when
# asked (asked 2026-10-06); no other crate has a database client.
#
# Adapted from VectorEffects. Four layers, each checking what it can check:
#
#   1. Hand-written sources     -- any absolute URL is suspicious, so flag all,
#      except in `pe-env` and `pe-trackers`, where every URL must name one of
#      that crate's allow-listed hosts.
#   2. Dependencies             -- a network client crate may be a direct
#      dependency of those two crates only, and no C library that the five
#      targets cannot all build (OpenSSL, blosc) may be in the lockfile.
#   3. The built bundle         -- only remote *resource references* are flagged.
#      A minified bundle is full of documentation URLs inside error strings
#      (React links to react.dev when it throws); scanning it for `http` finds
#      hundreds of those and nothing useful. What matters is whether the HTML or
#      CSS actually loads something remote.
#   4. The CSP                  -- the runtime enforcement. Even if a remote URL
#      slipped through, `default-src 'self'` stops the load. So the CSP itself
#      is checked for having been weakened.

# is admitted and nothing wider:
#   - `hyper` in [dependencies] with features from {server, http1} only;
#   - `hyper-util` in [dependencies] with features from {tokio} only;

#     from {server, macros, transport-streamable-http-server} only (its
