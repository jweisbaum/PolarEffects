/**
 * Errors as a person reads them, in the interface language (invariant 7,

 *
 * Rust's messages are English sentences written for logs and bug reports.
 * What the interface shows is keyed by the error's `kind` — the stable
 * discriminant every `AppError` carries — and translated here; the English
 * message goes in `detail`, which the interface shows only as a tooltip.
 * A kind this table does not know, and a failure that is not from Rust at
 * all (a dialog plugin that threw), fall back to a translated generic line.
