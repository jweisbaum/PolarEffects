//! The skill a client is given with the service (spec.md 3.7): a `SKILL.md`
//! saying when to reach for PolarExplorer and how.
//!
//! The server's instructions argue for the tools from inside the server's
//! own corner of the context, 2,048 characters of it in Claude Code and
//! possibly none elsewhere (`tools::guide`). A skill is the other place a
//! client looks when it decides how to do what it was asked: its
//! description is in front of the model from the first message, beside the
//! skills that write spreadsheets and PDFs — which is the company a request
//! for "a polar for this boat" otherwise keeps. VectorEffects added it when
//! sessions with the service connected were reported not to use it, even
//! asked to by name.
//!
//! It is not a second text to keep in step: the body **is**
//! [`guide::GUIDE`]. Only the description is its own, because it is read
//! where no tool is in sight and has to stand without them.
//!
//! Claude Code reads a personal skill from `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`, so
//! *Add to Claude Code* writes it there. Claude Desktop takes a skill as a
//! zip the person uploads, so *Add to Claude Desktop* writes the zip beside
//! the extension and the dialog says where. Nothing here opens a socket or
//! starts a process (invariant 4); it writes outside the application's own
//! folders, which is why it happens on that click and at no other time.
