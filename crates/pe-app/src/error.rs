//! Application-level error type and its IPC wire form.
//!
//! Library crates return typed errors (`thiserror`); this is where they are
//! collapsed for the frontend. The wire form keeps a machine-readable `kind`
//! alongside the message so the UI can branch without parsing English.
//!
//! **A message names three things** (spec.md 1.4): what the application was
//! trying to do, what it was doing it to, and what went wrong. A library error
//! is only ever the third — `No such file or directory (os error 2)` is true
//! and useless — so the first two are attached at the call site with
//! [`Context::doing`], which is the only place that knows them.
//!
//! Library crates add their own variants here, each with its own `kind`, as
//! they gain error types.
