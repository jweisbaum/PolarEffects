//! Document mutations, each one reversible (spec.md 4.6).
//!
//! Every change to a project goes through a [`Command`]. A command carries
//! both the new value and the value it displaced, so undo is exact rather
//! than recomputed — the VectorEffects pattern. Snapshotting the whole
//! document per edit was rejected there for cost, and here a project holds
//! hundreds of thousands of samples.
//!
//! **Apply checks the document is in the state the command was built
//! against.** A command whose `before` no longer matches refuses with
//! [`CoreError::Stale`] rather than silently writing, so a bug elsewhere
//! cannot make undo restore the wrong value.
